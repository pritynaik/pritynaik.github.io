											<ul>
												<li>Led and motivated a team of 50 BBA and UW double degree’s brightest business students every Sunday in fall during case practice for Canada's largest undergraduate case competitions, JDCC.</li>

I was the VP of charity in my second year and then became the youngest captain leading the team in my third year. Case practices happen every Sunday 9am to 5pm for four months leading up to competition in January. January 2020 my team <b>won</b> School of the Year and Academic Cup of the Year out of 12 Canadian Universities (500 students) at JDCC weekend.
