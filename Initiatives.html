									<p>During the covid-19 lockdown, I finally had some downtime to learn some new skills and about myself. Iâ€™m strategic and tactical, a mix of visionary and innovator who loves the details, creative, yet practical. This is according to adobe creative quiz and a self-diagnosis. Want to learn your creative style, check out the quiz <a href="https://mycreativetype.com">here</a>. Learning how to use tools such as adobe lightroom, programming languages, social media platforms and team collaboration tools in 2020 are sure to come in handy in the future!</p>

											<h2>New Interests</h2>

									<p>To keep myself mentally and physically healthy, I made reading, working out, being creative and self-care a priority. Reading has always been my favorite escapism tool to wind down after a busy day. So, my friends and I have started a virtual book club where we recommend, discuss and explore new genres. Staying active and going to the gym has never been a priority, but 6 months ago I was introduced to jumping rope. It changed my whole perspective to staying fit as I am constantly challenged and learning new tricks. I always have ideas and my sister got most of the artistic genes so growing up she would take my vision and help me execute. However, the graphics you see on this website were created by me this time on Canva but photoshop is the next tool I am going to tackle! Something else, I discovered was the secret power of aloe. Let me tell you, this was the plot twist I never knew I needed, especially if you have dry skin like me. </p>

											<h2>New Projects</h2>
										</header>
										<span class="image main"><img src="images/new projects.png" alt="" /></span>
										<p>A little secret about me I would like to share is when I get involved in a project, I like to have an understanding off all the moving parts so I can plan projects in a detailed way and come up with effective solutions to any problems. With the goal of working in the digital space, I know having an understanding of web design and building will beneficial. The world of coding has always been daunting however, the pros of learning outweighed the cons. Setting up my first basic webpage was so fulfilling that I decided to build my own website! Using HTML, CSS and JavaScript this website came to life with a steep learning curve.</p>
										<p>Since school and work were virtual, I was naturally on social media sites trying to kill free time. I saw the importance of leveraging social media for a business when small businesses began to suffer during lockdowns. This was the beginning of my obsession with creating tool kits on social media branding, strategy and content creation. I even have a Pinterest board where I pin new ideas. Hopefully, one day I can use my skills to help local business in my area to leverage the power of being digital, especially if they are like my parents! In my free time, I consult a small influencer on how to grow her platform. Over 3 months of my assistance, she has grown from 500K to about 1.5K followers! </p>
										<p>If you think there are any other skills or projects I should work on feel free to send an email. For getting this far in my website, thank you, I appreciate it! The last page to check out is my bucket list. </p>
